#Ollivanders Reborn
##What is Ollivanders Reborn?

Ollivanders Reborn is an updated version of the fork of the original Ollivanders plugin named Ollivanders 2 for the Spigot platform.  It is currently in use and being maintained by myself.  Ollivanders seeks to bring the world of Harry Potter to Minecraft.

My reasoning for forking this plugin is to fix some of the bugs which have been caused in recent versions. I am willing to do a pull request of these fixes to the owner if he asks. Spell Journal needs to be reworked by him though as it uses some deprecated methods.
