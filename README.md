#Ollivanders Reborn
##What is Ollivanders Reborn?

Ollivanders Reborn is a updated version of the fork of the original Ollivanders plugin named Ollivanders 2 for the Spigot platform.  It is currently in use and being maintained by myself.  Ollivanders seeks to bring the world of Harry Potter to Minecraft.

My reasoning for forking this plugin is to fix some of the bugs which have been caused by mistakes of the developer.
